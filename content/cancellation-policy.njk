**We are not responsible and  cannot be held responsible for any misunderstandings regarding our Cancellation Policy, so please take the time to read it carefully.**

In general, no orders can be canceled and no cancellations are guaranteed. We can try to accommodate a request, but we cannot guarantee customer service will see your request, or be able to accommodate your request, before the package is shipped to you.
This policy includes cancellations for any reason, as well as requests for changes in shipping addresses. If a package is not delivered due to an inaccurate address provided by the customer at the time of purchase HAPPY SHAMAN is not responsible for a replacement, refund, or credit.

While we will try to accommodate any requests we receive, if we are unable to cancel your order, you will need to mail back the unopened product, in perfect condition, at your own expense, in order to get a refund. If a package was shipped to a wrong address input by you at checkout, it is up to you to retrieve the package and return the unopened product, in perfect condition, back to us before you can get a refund.
