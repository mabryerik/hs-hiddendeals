Blueberry Sugar is [a] cross of Grape Cream Cake 2.1 and Blueberry Frosting [...] with all the deep sugary sweetness you could ask for! The effect is balanced as well, with a noticeable [...] uplift and happiness paired with some really nice relaxation. [...] Chosen for its excellent flavor and strong terpene profile, to go along with its strong growth style and bud structure. <cite>- <a href="{{ source }}">SeedFinder</a></cite>
