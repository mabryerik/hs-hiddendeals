Runtz is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through a delicious cross of the infamous Zkittlez X Gelato strains. Named for the iconic candy, Runtz brings on a super delicious fruity flavor with tropical citrus and sour berries galore. The aroma is very similar, although with a sharp spicy pineapple effect that turns slightly pungent as the sticky little nugs are broken apart and burned. [...] This bud has dense grape-shaped olive green nugs with thin orange hairs, dark purple undertones and a coating of frosty tiny white purple-tinted crystal trichomes. <cite>- <a href="{{ source }}">allbud</a></cite>
