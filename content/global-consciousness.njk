<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The Global Consciousness Project collects random numbers from around the world. These numbers are available on the GCP website. This website downloads those numbers once a minute and performs sophisticated analysis on these random numbers to see how coherent they are. That is, we compute how random the random numbers coming from the eggs really are. The theory is that the Global Consciousness of all Beings of the Planet affect these random numbers... Maybe they aren't quite as random as we thought.</p>

<p>This is a real time data analysis of the Global Consciousness Project. It collects the data each minute and runs statistics on the stream of random numbers generated by the project. This analysis is run 10 minutes behind the generation of the data. In this way, it can be seen as a real-time indicator of global consciousness coherence.</p>

<p>The probability time window is one and two hours; with the display showing the more coherent of the two. For more information on the algorithm you can read about it on the <a href="https://global-mind.org/science2.html#hypothesis" target="_blank">GCP Basic Science website.</a></p>

<h3>What it means</h3>

<p><strong>BLUE</strong> Significantly small network variance. Suggestive of deeply shared, internally motivated group focus. The index is above 95%</p>

<p><strong>LIGHT BLUE</strong> Small network variance. Probably chance fluctuation. The index is between 90% and 95%</p>

<p><strong>GREEN</strong> Normally random network variance. This is average or expected behavior. The index is between 40% and 90%</p>

<p><strong>YELLOW</strong> Slightly increased network variance. Probably chance fluctuation. The index is between 10% and 40%</p>

<p><strong>ORANGE</strong> Strongly increased network variance. May be chance fluctuation, with the index between 5% and 10%</p>

<p><strong>RED</strong> Significantly large network variance. Suggests broadly shared coherence of thought and emotion. The index is less than 5%.</p>
