<h3>YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

<p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the personal information you give us, such as your name, address and email address. When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address.</p>

<p>Email marketing and text messaging: With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates.</p>

<h3>CONSENT</h3>

<p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only. If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>

<h3>THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h3>

<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

<p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may  have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So, if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>

<p>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising provides consumers with the ability to manage certain choices online here and provides a tool for managing mobile choices here.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>When you click on links at our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow the industry’s best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>

<p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with an AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional industry standards.</p>
